# Overview

As a software engineer eager to enhance my skills, I developed a Kotlin-based calculator application to demonstrate proficiency in the language. This project served as a practical exercise to deepen my understanding of Kotlin syntax and reinforce fundamental programming concepts.

The calculator software is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root, power, and percentage calculations. Additionally, it includes features to display calculation history and demonstrate the creation and modification of collections, providing a comprehensive showcase of Kotlin functionalities.

My primary goal in creating this software was to solidify my grasp of Kotlin syntax and explore its capabilities in building practical applications. By implementing various mathematical operations and handling user input dynamically, I aimed to strengthen my problem-solving skills and familiarity with Kotlin's features.


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

For the development of this software, I utilized the following tools and technologies:

* IDE: JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA
* Programming Language: Kotlin
* Libraries: Standard Kotlin library for math functions (e.g., kotlin.math.pow, kotlin.math.sqrt)

# Future Work

While the calculator software provides basic functionality, there are areas for improvement and expansion in the future:
- Implement more advanced mathematical functions, such as trigonometric operations and logarithms. 
- Enhance user interface with graphical components for a more intuitive user experience. 
- Add support for handling complex numbers and mathematical expressions. 
- Implement unit tests to ensure the reliability and accuracy of calculations. 
- Explore additional Kotlin features and best practices to optimize code structure and performance.
